## Used Technologies

There isn't magic here, this project just uses front-end technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS / SCSS
- JavaScript

### Technical details

This project uses SCSS.
If you need to change the .scss files, adding more files, or editing the existing file, you'll need to compile it again in .css files.

To recompile the .scss files, it's required:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (version >= 6)

Then, just run:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run scss
```
